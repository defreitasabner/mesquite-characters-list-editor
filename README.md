# Mesquite Characters List's Editor

This simple software was created to quickly convert  an exported characters list from software Mesquite, to a more compact and readble charaters list, to be used in scientific papers.

## How it works?

It was written in Python 3 and using the built-in module 're', to work with regular expressions to collect and rearrange the information.

## Examples

### Standard Mesquite's characters list exported (input):

![Standard Mesquite's output characters list](assets%5Cimg%5Cmesquite_output.jpg)

### This software's characters list (output): 

 ![Output](assets%5Cimg%5Coutput.jpg)

 ## Future implementations

 It was the first implementation of this software. In the future, I want to add:

- Other types of rearrangement pattern to Output
- Possibilty to export output file in `.csv`
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- A simple GUI (Graphic User Interface)
- Generate an executable to desktop
